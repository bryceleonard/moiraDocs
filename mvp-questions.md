‚ùì NEEDS CLARIFICATION - Vague Requirements
Completed Create implementation questions for ambiguous requirements (3/5)
ü§ñ LLM Chat Interface - "Moira"
Client says: "Need to further define use cases to make sure the LLM delivers trusted value"

Questions for Client:
1. Medical vs General Chat: Is "Moira" providing medical advice or general health coaching? This affects FDA/HIPAA compliance significantly.
2. Integration with Care Plans: How should Moira access/update patient care plans in Healthie?
3. Voice vs Text: Client mentions "voice or chat" - which is priority for MVP?
4. Safety Boundaries: What medical topics should Moira refuse to discuss?

Your Architecture Gap: Your medical-ai-context-requirements.md provides excellent safety frameworks, but specific Moira chatbot implementation is missing.

üé® "Positive Emotion" & Premium Experience  
Client says: "Develop the 'positive emotion' of becoming a member of Moira. (Human + Digital + Trusted + Premium)"

Questions for Client:
1. Brand Guidelines: What visual/UX patterns convey "premium healthcare"?
2. Onboarding Flow: What makes someone feel "special" when joining?
3. Messaging Tone: Examples of "Human + Digital + Trusted" communication style?
4. Success Metrics: How do we measure "positive emotion"?

Your Architecture Gap: UI/UX specifications and brand guidelines not documented.

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Habit Building & Nudges
Client says: "Build the Moira science of habit building formation layer with appropriate nudges (what, when, how and measure)"

Questions for Client:
1. Nudge Triggers: What data triggers nudges? (Wearable data, appointment findings, time-based?)
2. Nudge Channels: Push notifications, SMS, in-app, email?
3. Personalization: How do nudges adapt to individual preferences/progress?
4. Clinical Integration: Should nudges be prescribed by providers or algorithm-driven?

Your Architecture Gap: Behavioral psychology and nudge system not architected.

üåç Local Weather Integration
Client asks: "Could we integrate with local weather per the member's location?"

Questions for Client:
1. Use Cases: How does weather affect health recommendations? (Exercise, medication, mood?)
2. Privacy: Track location continuously or ask users to set home location?
3. Health Correlations: What weather conditions trigger health alerts?

Your Architecture Gap: Weather API integration and location services not documented.

üé≠ Social Prescriptions & Local Events
Client says: "Curate a list of social engagements for the member in their local market to help with 'social prescriptions'"

Questions for Client:
1. Event Sources: Partner with Eventbrite, Meetup, local organizations?
2. Curation Logic: AI-recommended or human-curated events?
3. Health Integration: How do social activities connect to care plans?
4. Geographical Scope: How local is "local"? (5 miles, city, region?)

Your Architecture Gap: Social prescriptions system completely new requirement.

üë• Human Health Coach Outreach  
Client says: "TBD (weekly vs. monthly outreach)"

Questions for Client:
1. Coach Staffing: In-house coaches or contractor model?
2. Outreach Triggers: Scheduled check-ins or event-driven?
3. Integration with Healthie: How do coaches access/update patient records?
4. Escalation Protocols: When do coaches involve clinical providers?

Your Architecture Gap: Human coach workflow not in current architecture.

üìÖ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - September Timeline
Completed Develop detailed implementation plan with timeline (4/5)
Week 1-2: Foundation (READY TO START)
Based on your existing architecture:
‚Ä¢  ‚úÖ Set up PostgreSQL with your documented schemas  
‚Ä¢  ‚úÖ Implement Healthie EHR integration using your GraphQL research
‚Ä¢  ‚úÖ Deploy HIPAA-compliant cloud environment (AWS/GCP)
‚Ä¢  ‚úÖ Basic patient profiles with consent management

Week 3-4: Core Features (ARCHITECTURE EXISTS)
‚Ä¢  ‚úÖ Secure messaging via Healthie's native capabilities
‚Ä¢  ‚úÖ Wearable API integrations (HealthKit, Oura, Withings, Fitbit)
‚Ä¢  ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS SPECS: Weather integration (pending client clarity)
‚Ä¢  ‚úÖ Twilio SMS/voice setup

Week 5-6: AI & Recording (PARTIALLY READY)
‚Ä¢  ‚úÖ Virtual appointment recording (Zoom + Healthie integration documented)
‚Ä¢  ‚úÖ External appointment recording (mobile app architecture exists)  
‚Ä¢  ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS SPECS: "Moira" chatbot implementation
‚Ä¢  ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS SPECS: AI safety guardrails for chat vs analysis

Week 7-8: User Experience (MAJOR GAPS)
‚Ä¢  ‚ùå MISSING: "Positive emotion" UI/UX design specs
‚Ä¢  ‚ùå MISSING: Senior-friendly accessibility guidelines
‚Ä¢  ‚ùå MISSING: Habit building & nudge system design
‚Ä¢  ‚ùå MISSING: Social prescriptions architecture

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RISKS & DECISIONS
Completed Highlight technical risks and decision points (5/5)
üî• HIGH RISK: Moira LLM Compliance
Your medical-ai-context-requirements.md shows deep understanding of FDA/HIPAA requirements, but client hasn't defined Moira's medical scope. If Moira provides medical advice, you need FDA compliance strategy.

üî• HIGH RISK: Scope Creep on "Premium Experience"  
Client wants "positive emotion" and "premium feel" but hasn't defined success metrics or design standards. This could become endless iteration.

üî• MEDIUM RISK: Social Prescriptions Data Sources
"Local social engagements" requires partnerships with event platforms, local organizations, or manual curation - none of which are architected.

üî• MEDIUM RISK: Human Coach Integration
Your architecture is heavily automated. Adding human coaches requires new workflows, staffing models, and potentially new tools beyond Healthie.

üí° MY RECOMMENDATIONS

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (This Week)
1. Clarify Moira's Medical Scope: Is it medical advice or wellness coaching? This affects entire regulatory strategy.
2. Define "Premium Experience": Get specific UI/UX requirements and success metrics from client.
3. Prioritize Features: September scope is ambitious - what's truly MVP vs nice-to-have?

TECHNICAL PRIORITIES (Start Here)
1. Week 1: Deploy your documented PostgreSQL + Healthie integration
2. Week 2: Implement basic mobile recording using your existing architecture  
3. Week 3: Add wearable integrations (you have the patterns documented)
4. Week 4: Build basic AI analysis pipeline (your safety protocols are excellent)

CLIENT REQUIREMENTS GATHERING
Schedule stakeholder meetings to define:
‚Ä¢  Moira chatbot medical boundaries and compliance requirements
‚Ä¢  UI/UX design standards for "premium" experience  
‚Ä¢  Success metrics for "positive emotion" and habit building
‚Ä¢  Human coach workflow and staffing model
‚Ä¢  Social prescriptions data sources and curation process

üéØ BOTTOM LINE

Your technical architecture is exceptionally well-documented and ready for implementation. The main blocker is that client requirements are underspecified for several key features.

You can start building immediately with:
‚Ä¢  PostgreSQL + Healthie integration
‚Ä¢  Basic patient profiles with consent
‚Ä¢  Wearable device integrations  
‚Ä¢  Mobile recording architecture

You need client clarification before building:
‚Ä¢  Moira LLM chatbot (medical scope unclear)
‚Ä¢  "Premium experience" UI/UX (no design specs)
‚Ä¢  Habit building system (behavioral psychology undefined)
‚Ä¢  Social prescriptions (data sources unknown)
‚Ä¢  Human coach integration (workflow undefined)

Your documentation shows this will be an excellent healthcare platform - the technical foundation is solid and the user stories are well-researched. The challenge is translating the client's vision into specific, implementable requirements.
