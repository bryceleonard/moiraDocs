# Moira Healthcare - Data Lake Simplified

## What is a Data Lake (Plain English)

A **data lake** is like a central storage and processing hub between your **data sources** (patient recordings, Healthie, wearables) and your **databases** (PostgreSQL and BigQuery).

```
[ Data Sources ] → [ Data Lake ] → [ Databases ]
```

## 🏊 Data Lake vs. HIPAA-Compliant Cloud

### **HIPAA-Compliant Cloud = The Foundation**
Think of the HIPAA-compliant cloud as your **secure building** with:
- Security guards (access controls)
- Vault doors (encryption)
- Security cameras (audit logging)
- Compliance certifications

### **Data Lake = What's Inside the Building**
The data lake is all the **equipment and processes** inside that building:
- Storage containers (Google Cloud Storage)
- Processing machinery (Cloud Functions, Cloud Run)
- Conveyor belts (ETL pipelines)
- Communication systems (Pub/Sub)

## 🌊 What the Data Lake Actually Does

### **1. Raw Data Storage**
```
CLOUD STORAGE BUCKETS (Raw Data)
├── 🎙️ raw-audio-recordings/
│   ├── appointment-123-zoom.mp4
│   ├── appointment-456-mobile-segment1.m4a
│   └── appointment-456-mobile-segment2.m4a
├── 📝 raw-transcripts/
│   ├── appointment-123-transcript.txt
│   └── appointment-456-transcript.txt
├── ⌚ wearable-data/
│   ├── patient-789-heartrate-20250901.json
│   └── patient-789-sleep-20250901.json
└── 🏥 healthie-exports/
    ├── patient-profiles-20250901.json
    └── appointments-20250901.json
```

### **2. Data Processing Functions**
```
CLOUD FUNCTIONS (Audio Processing)
├── audio-enhancement.js
│   └── "Removes background noise, enhances voices"
├── segment-merger.js
│   └── "Combines paused/resumed segments"
└── transcription-processor.js
    └── "Converts audio to text with Deepgram"

CLOUD RUN (AI Analysis)
├── medical-conversation-analyzer
│   └── "Extracts clinical info from transcripts"
├── emergency-detector
│   └── "Flags urgent medical situations"
└── insight-generator
    └── "Creates actionable patient recommendations"
```

### **3. Real-Time Communication**
```
PUB/SUB TOPICS (Event Streaming)
├── appointment-completed
│   └── "Triggered when appointment ends"
├── recording-ready-for-processing
│   └── "Triggered when recording uploaded"
├── analysis-completed
│   └── "Triggered when AI analysis done"
└── emergency-detected
    └── "Urgent notification needed"
```

### **4. Database Pipelines**
```
DATAFLOW PIPELINES (ETL)
├── postgres-to-bigquery.js
│   └── "Syncs operational data to analytics every 15 mins"
├── wearable-data-processor.js
│   └── "Normalizes and stores wearable data"
└── healthie-synchronizer.js
    └── "Keeps PostgreSQL in sync with Healthie"
```

## 🔄 Data Lake Flow Examples

### **Example 1: Processing an External Appointment Recording**
```
1. Patient uploads recording from mobile app
   ↓
2. Recording stored in Cloud Storage bucket
   ↓
3. Pub/Sub message: "New recording available"
   ↓
4. Cloud Function: Audio enhancement
   ↓
5. Cloud Function: Transcription with Deepgram
   ↓
6. Cloud Run: Medical conversation analysis
   ↓
7. Results stored in PostgreSQL
   ↓
8. Dataflow ETL: Sync to BigQuery for analytics
```

### **Example 2: Emergency Detection**
```
1. AI analysis detects "chest pain" in transcript
   ↓
2. Emergency flag set in analysis results
   ↓
3. Pub/Sub message: "Emergency detected"
   ↓
4. Cloud Function: Emergency handler
   ↓
5. Notification sent to patient's care team
   ↓
6. Family alert sent if permission granted
   ↓
7. Emergency data stored for analytics
```

## 🛠️ Data Lake in September Implementation

For September, you need to set up the data lake components in this order:

### **Week 1: Storage Foundation**
```
1. Set up Google Cloud project with HIPAA compliance
2. Create Cloud Storage buckets for raw data
3. Configure encryption and access controls
```

### **Week 2: Processing Functions**
```
1. Build Cloud Functions for audio processing
2. Set up Cloud Run containers for AI analysis
3. Configure Pub/Sub topics for real-time events
```

### **Week 3: Database Connections**
```
1. Deploy PostgreSQL operational database
2. Set up Healthie API integration
3. Build ETL pipelines to PostgreSQL
```

### **Week 4: Analytics Integration**
```
1. Deploy BigQuery data warehouse
2. Create Dataflow ETL from PostgreSQL to BigQuery
3. Implement analytics functions
```

## 💡 Why Your Data Lake Matters

### **1. Scalability**
The data lake can process thousands of recordings simultaneously without affecting your application performance.

### **2. Flexibility**
You can add new data sources (like weather APIs) or new processing steps without changing your core database.

### **3. Compliance**
All processing happens within your HIPAA-compliant environment, with complete audit trails.

### **4. Performance**
Heavy processing (like AI analysis) happens in the data lake, not your operational database.

### **5. Cost Efficiency**
Process data only when needed, scale resources up/down automatically.

## 🎯 Bottom Line

The data lake is the "processing factory" between your raw data and your databases. It handles all the heavy lifting of cleaning, analyzing, and transforming healthcare data so your application stays fast and your analytics stay powerful.

For September, focus on setting up the core storage and processing components, then iteratively add more sophisticated analytics as you build out the platform.
