# Phone Onboarding - Complete Implementation Guide

## 📞 Business Case & Strategy

### **Why Phone Onboarding Over Self-Service?**

Phone-based onboarding is actually **superior** for healthcare, especially for:
- **Senior patients** (less tech-savvy, prefer human interaction)
- **Premium concierge services** (differentiates from "just another health app")  
- **Complex medical situations** requiring human assistance and care coordination
- **HIPAA-sensitive onboarding** conversations with proper consent documentation

### **Competitive Advantage**
Most health apps **force** patients to:
- Download app first with no guidance
- Self-register with complex medical settings
- Figure out consent and privacy alone
- Contact support if they get stuck

**Moira provides:**
- ✅ Human explanation before any technology
- ✅ Pre-configured settings based on conversation
- ✅ Personal care coordinator relationship from day one
- ✅ Proactive follow-up and support

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Account Creation Service**
```typescript
class PatientOnboardingService {
  async createPatientFromPhoneIntake(intakeData: PhoneIntakeData): Promise<OnboardingResult> {
    
    // 1. Create patient in Healthie EHR first (single source of truth)
    const healthiePatient = await this.healthieAPI.createPatient({
      first_name: intakeData.firstName,
      last_name: intakeData.lastName,

      phone: intakeData.phone,
      date_of_birth: intakeData.dateOfBirth,
      address: intakeData.address,
      // Set initial password (patient will change on first login)
      password: this.generateSecureTemporaryPassword(),

      custom_fields: {
        onboarding_method: 'phone',
        onboarding_date: new Date().toISOString(),
        care_coordinator: intakeData.coordinatorId,
        intake_call_duration: intakeData.callDurationMinutes
      }
    });

    // 2. Create extended profile in PostgreSQL (app-specific data)
    const extendedProfile = await this.createExtendedProfile({
      healthie_patient_id: healthiePatient.id,
      // Set consents based on phone conversation
      audio_recording_consent: intakeData.recordingConsent,

      family_members_invited: setupData.familyMembersAdded || 0
    });
    
    // 3. Set up optional integrations
    if (setupData.healthkitAuthorized) {
      await this.setupHealthKitIntegration(setupData.patientId);
    }
    
    // 4. Send completion notification to care coordinator

### **Admin Portal for Care Coordinators**
```typescript
interface AdminOnboardingPortal {
  // Main patient creation form
  createPatientForm: {
    basicInfo: {
      firstName: string;
      lastName: string;
      dateOfBirth: Date;
      email: string;
      phone: string;
      address: Address;
    };
    medicalInfo: {
      primaryConcerns: string[];
      currentMedications: Medication[];
      conditions: Condition[];
      allergies: string[];
      emergencyContact: EmergencyContact;
    };
    consentPreferences: {
      audioRecordingConsent: boolean;
      aiAnalysisConsent: boolean;
      familySharingConsent: boolean;
      consentDiscussionNotes: string;
    };
    familyMembers: FamilyMemberInfo[];
    appointmentScheduling: {
      scheduleInitialAppointment: boolean;
      preferredProvider?: string;
      appointmentDate?: Date;
      appointmentType?: string;
    };
    coordinatorNotes: {
      callDuration: number;
      techComfortLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
      specialNotes: string;
      followUpNeeded: boolean;
    };
  };
  
  // Batch operations for busy practices
  batchPatientCreation: (patients: PhoneIntakeData[]) => Promise<BatchResult>;
  
  // Follow-up management dashboard
  onboardingStatusTracking: {
    pendingFirstLogin: Patient[];
    completedSetup: Patient[];
    needsFollowUp: Patient[];
    technicalIssues: Patient[];
  };
  
  // Success metrics and reporting
  onboardingAnalytics: {
    completionRates: OnboardingMetrics;
    averageSetupTime: number;
    coordinatorPerformance: CoordinatorMetrics[];
    patientSatisfactionScores: SatisfactionMetrics;
  };
}
```

## 📊 Success Metrics & KPIs

### **Onboarding Completion Tracking**
```sql
-- Track success by onboarding method and coordinator
CREATE VIEW onboarding_success_metrics AS
SELECT 
    onboarding_method,
    onboarding_coordinator,
    COUNT(*) as total_patients,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN app_onboarding_completed THEN 1 END) as completed_onboarding,
    (COUNT(CASE WHEN app_onboarding_completed THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) as completion_rate,
    AVG(EXTRACT(DAYS FROM first_login_date - created_at)) as avg_days_to_first_login,
    AVG(EXTRACT(DAYS FROM onboarding_completed_date - created_at)) as avg_onboarding_duration
FROM patient_extended_profiles 
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
