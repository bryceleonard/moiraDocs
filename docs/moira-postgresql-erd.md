## Database Design Principles

### **üìû Phone Onboarding Architecture**
- **Premium onboarding**: Care coordinators create accounts via phone intake calls
- **Extended profiles**: Healthie handles auth, our table handles app-specific functionality  
- **Consent management**: Detailed consent discussions documented during phone calls
- **Follow-up tracking**: Automated monitoring of patient adoption and engagement

### **üîó External System Integration**
- **`healthie_patient_id`**: Links to Healthie EHR as single source of truth
- **`healthie_appointment_id`**: All appointments managed in Healthie first
- **External providers**: Stored locally when appointment provider_id is null in Healthie

### **üéôÔ∏è Recording Architecture**
- **Flexible recording**: Supports both Zoom (automatic) and mobile (pause/resume)
- **Segment-based**: External appointments can be paused/resumed with full audit trail
- **Quality tracking**: Audio quality metrics for processing optimization

### **ü§ñ AI Analysis Structure**
- **JSONB fields**: Flexible storage for structured medical data
- **Confidence scoring**: AI analysis includes confidence levels
- **Emergency detection**: Automated flagging of urgent findings
- **Care coordination**: Cross-provider communication triggers

### **üë• Family Dashboard Security**
- **Permission-based**: Granular control over what family can see
- **View-only MVP**: Family members cannot edit, only view
- **Token-based invites**: Secure invitation system
- **Relationship tracking**: Different permissions by relationship type

## Technical Implementation Notes

### **Performance Optimizations**
- Index on `healthie_patient_id` for fast patient lookups
- Index on `appointment_status` + `analysis_status` for processing queues
- Index on `patient_user_id` + `created_at` for timeline queries
- Index on `urgency_level` + `created_at` for emergency processing

### **Data Integrity**
- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- Enum types prevent invalid status values  
- NOT NULL constraints on critical fields
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate invitations

### **HIPAA Compliance**
- All PII encrypted at rest and in transit
- Audit trails with created_at/updated_at timestamps
- Granular access controls through family_dashboard_access
- Secure token-based family invitations
