  // Automatic escalation for critical findings
  criticalValueRanges: {
    "blood_pressure_systolic": { critical_high: 180, critical_low: 70 },
    "blood_pressure_diastolic": { critical_high: 120, critical_low: 40 },
    "heart_rate": { critical_high: 150, critical_low: 40 },
    "oxygen_saturation": { critical_low: 88 }
  }
};
```

### **AI Response Safety Guardrails**
```typescript
const aiSafetyGuardrails = {
  // Never provide definitive diagnoses
  diagnosticLanguage: {
    avoid: ["You have...", "This is definitely...", "You are diagnosed with..."],
    use: ["This may suggest...", "Consider discussing with your doctor...", "Symptoms consistent with..."]
  },
  
  // Always encourage professional consultation
  professionalReferral: {
    conditions: ["new symptoms", "worsening symptoms", "medication changes", "abnormal test results"],
    urgency_levels: {
      routine: "Schedule appointment within 2 weeks",
      urgent: "Contact provider within 24 hours", 
      emergent: "Seek immediate medical attention"
