# Hybrid Healthcare App Architecture
## Practice + Personal Health AI Model

### Executive Summary

This document outlines a hybrid healthcare application model that combines:
1. **A legitimate healthcare practice** powered by Healthie's EHR/practice management platform
2. **A personal health AI assistant** that provides ambient listening and care coordination across all healthcare touchpoints

---

## Core Concept: Dual-Mode Architecture

### Mode 1: Your Practice Appointments (Full Healthie Integration)
Your app operates as a legitimate healthcare practice using Healthie as your complete EHR/practice management system.

### Mode 2: External Appointments (Personal Health Records) 
When patients see outside specialists, your app acts as their personal health assistant.

---

## Business Model

### Value Proposition
"The only healthcare practice that follows you everywhere - providing in-home care and AI-powered health coordination across all your medical appointments."

### Competitive Advantages
1. **Complete Care Continuity**: You see the full picture across all their healthcare
2. **AI-Enhanced Care**: Ambient listening at every appointment (yours and external)
3. **Convenience**: In-home care + comprehensive health tracking

---

## Technical Architecture

### Your Practice Infrastructure (Healthie-Powered)

```graphql
# Schedule in-home care visits
mutation createAppointment($input: CreateAppointmentInput!) {
  createAppointment(input: {
    patient_id: $patientId
    provider_id: $yourCareTeamMemberId  
    appointment_type_id: $inHomeCareTypeId
    date: $scheduledDate
    contact_type: "in_person"
    location: $patientHomeAddress
  }) {
    appointment {
      id
      patient { name, address }
      provider { name, credentials }
    }
  }
}
```

### Your Care Team Types in Healthie:
- Primary care providers
- Nurses and care coordinators  
- Mental health specialists
- Nutritionists/dietitians
- Physical therapists

### Practice Appointment Types
```graphql
mutation createAppointmentTypes {
  createAppointmentType(input: {
    name: "In-Home Primary Care Visit"
    length: 60
    clients_can_book: true
    contact_type_overrides: ["in_person"]
  }) { appointmentType { id } }
  
  createAppointmentType(input: {
    name: "Virtual Care Consultation" 
    length: 30
    clients_can_book: true
    contact_type_overrides: ["video_chat"]
  }) { appointmentType { id } }
}
```

### External Appointments Database Schema

```sql
-- For appointments outside your practice
CREATE TABLE external_appointments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  patient_id UUID REFERENCES patients(id),
  
  -- External appointment details
  provider_name VARCHAR(255),
  facility_name VARCHAR(255),
  specialty VARCHAR(100),
  appointment_date TIMESTAMP,
  
  -- Your app's value-add
  recording_id UUID,
  ai_summary TEXT,
  action_items JSONB,
  follow_up_recommendations TEXT,
  
  -- Integration opportunities  
  needs_practice_follow_up BOOLEAN,
  recommended_practice_appointment_type VARCHAR(100),
  
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE recordings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  appointment_id UUID, -- Can reference either Healthie appointments or external_appointments
  appointment_type ENUM('practice', 'external'),
  
  audio_file_url VARCHAR(500),
  transcript TEXT,
  duration_seconds INTEGER,
  
  -- AI Analysis Results
  chief_complaint TEXT,
  diagnosis TEXT[],
  medications JSONB,
  vitals JSONB,
  action_items JSONB,
  
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Patient Experience

### Unified Dashboard
```typescript
const patientDashboard = {
  // Appointments with YOUR practice (from Healthie)
  practiceAppointments: [
    {
      id: "healthie_123",
      type: "in_home_primary_care",
      provider: "Dr. Sarah Chen (Your Practice)",
      date: "2024-01-20T10:00:00",
      location: "Patient's Home",
      hasRecording: true,
      status: "scheduled"
    }
  ],
  
  // External specialist appointments (patient-created)
  externalAppointments: [
    {
      id: "external_456", 
      type: "cardiology_consult",
      provider: "Dr. Robert Kim (Metro Cardiology)",
      date: "2024-01-18T14:00:00",
      location: "Metro Medical Center",
      hasRecording: true,
      status: "completed"
    }
  ]
};
```

### User Journey Examples

#### Story 1: In-Home Care Visit (Healthie Integrated)
> **Patient:** "I need to schedule my monthly check-up"
> 
> **Your App:** Shows available slots from your practice via Healthie API
> 
> **Flow:** Book → Provider arrives at home → Ambient recording → Summary saved to Healthie EHR → Follow-up care coordinated

#### Story 2: External Specialist Visit (Personal Health AI)
> **Patient:** "I'm seeing a cardiologist tomorrow"
> 
> **Your App:** "I'll help you track that visit. Just tap record when you're with Dr. Kim"
> 
> **Flow:** Patient logs visit → Ambient recording → AI analysis → Recommendations shared with your primary care team

---

## Data Integration & AI Coordination

### Unified Health Record
```typescript
// Comprehensive patient health record
const comprehensiveHealthRecord = {
  // Your practice data (from Healthie)
  primaryCareData: await getHealthieData(patientId),
  
  // External appointments (your database) 
  externalVisits: await getExternalAppointments(patientId),
  
  // AI insights across all care
  aiInsights: await analyzeCompleteHealthJourney(patientId)
};
```

### AI Care Coordination Example
```typescript
// AI detects concerning pattern from external specialist
const aiAlert = {
  source: "cardiology_visit_recording", 
  finding: "New medication may conflict with home care plan",
  recommendation: "Schedule urgent consultation with primary care provider",
  suggestedAction: "book_same_day_virtual_visit"
};

// Automatically offer booking with your practice
const urgentSlot = await findNextAvailableSlot(
  yourPrimaryCareProviderId,
  "urgent_consultation", 
  "today"
);
```

### Cross-Provider Intelligence
```typescript
// AI spots concerning patterns across different doctors
const aiAlert = {
  type: "medication_interaction",
  message: "Your dermatologist prescribed medication that may interact with your blood pressure medication from Dr. Johnson",
  confidence: 0.95,
  recommendation: "Ask your pharmacist about potential interactions"
};
```
