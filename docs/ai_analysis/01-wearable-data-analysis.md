# Wearable Data Streaming Analysis

## Overview

The wearable data analysis system provides continuous monitoring of patient health metrics through smartwatches and fitness trackers, automatically detecting concerning patterns and generating clinical insights for healthcare providers.

## Simple Mechanics

**What it does:** Constantly watches your health data from smartwatches/fitness trackers

**How it works:**
- Your Apple Watch sends heart rate every 30 seconds → AI checks "is this normal for you?"
- If heart rate suddenly spikes to 140 while sitting → AI says "something's wrong, alert someone"  
- If you usually walk 5,000 steps but only walked 500 today → AI notes "patient less active, maybe feeling worse"
- Like having a nurse constantly looking at your vital signs monitor

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow Strategy

**Recommended Approach: Cloud API Integration**
```
Wearables → Cloud APIs → Your Server → Healthie Integration
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No mobile app needs to run constantly
- ✅ Better battery life for patients
- ✅ More reliable data collection
- ✅ Works with existing wearables patients already own

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Cloud API Integration (MVP Launch)
```python
# MVP wearable integration
SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = {
    'apple_health': AppleHealthAPI,
    'fitbit': FitbitAPI,
    'garmin': GarminAPI
}

def sync_patient_wearables(patient_id):
    # Pull from whatever platform patient uses
    for platform, api in SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS.items():
        if patient.has_connected(platform):
            recent_data = api.get_data_since_last_sync(patient_id)
            process_with_ai(patient_id, recent_data)
            sync_to_healthie(patient_id, recent_data)
```

#### Phase 2: Risk-Based Monitoring
```python
class WearableDataPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sync_frequency = {
            'high_risk_patients': 15,  # minutes
            'regular_patients': 60,    # minutes  
            'stable_patients': 240     # minutes
        }
    
    def determine_sync_frequency(self, patient_id):
        risk_level = self.get_patient_risk_level(patient_id)
        return self.sync_frequency[risk_level]
```

## Data Processing Pipeline

### Step 1: Data Collection (PostgreSQL Storage)
```python
# Raw wearable data stored in YOUR database
healthkit_data = {
    "patient_id": "12345",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "heart_rate": 72,
    "steps": 8500,
    "sleep_hours": 7.2,
    "blood_pressure": "120/80",
    "raw_data_source": "apple_healthkit"
}

# Store in PostgreSQL for AI processing
postgres.store_raw_wearable_data(healthkit_data)
```

### Step 2: AI Analysis
```python
class WearableAnalysisEngine:
    def process_streaming_data(self, patient_id, wearable_data):
        # Multi-layered analysis approach
        
        # 1. Immediate Risk Detection (< 30 seconds)
        critical_alerts = self.detect_critical_events(wearable_data)
        if critical_alerts:
            self.trigger_emergency_protocol(patient_id, critical_alerts)
        
        # 2. Pattern Analysis (5-minute windows)
        trend_analysis = self.analyze_short_term_trends(wearable_data)
        
        # 3. Longitudinal Health Tracking (daily aggregation)
        health_trajectory = self.update_health_baseline(patient_id, wearable_data)
        
        # 4. Care Plan Adaptation Triggers
        if self.detect_care_plan_deviation(trend_analysis, health_trajectory):
            self.queue_care_plan_review(patient_id, trend_analysis)
```

### Step 3: Clinical Insights Generation
```python
def analyze_patient_trends(patient_id):
    # Pull last 30 days of data from YOUR database
    raw_data = postgres.get_patient_data(patient_id, days=30)
    
    # AI generates clinical insights
    ai_insights = {
        "patient_id": patient_id,
        "analysis_date": "2024-01-15",
        "heart_rate_trend": "IMPROVING - avg decreased from 85 to 75 bpm",
        "activity_trend": "STABLE - consistently meeting 8K step goal",
        "sleep_quality": "CONCERNING - average 5.2hrs, recommend evaluation",
        "clinical_summary": "Patient showing good cardiovascular improvement, but sleep issues need attention",
        "recommended_actions": ["Schedule sleep study", "Continue current activity level"],
        "alert_level": "MODERATE"
    }
    
    return ai_insights
```

### Step 4: Healthie Integration
```python
# What actually goes into Healthie
healthie_update = {
    "appointment_id": "healthie_appt_789",
    "clinical_note": """
    Wearable Data Summary (Jan 1-15, 2024):
    - Heart rate trend: IMPROVING (avg 75 bpm, down from 85)
    - Activity: Meeting step goals consistently 
    - Sleep: CONCERN - averaging 5.2 hours (recommend evaluation)
    
    AI Recommendation: Schedule sleep study consultation
    """,
    "care_plan_updates": [
        "Add sleep hygiene counseling to next appointment",
        "Continue current exercise routine - showing good results"
    ]
}

# Store in Healthie as structured clinical data
healthie_api.add_clinical_note(healthie_update)
```

## Database Design

### PostgreSQL Schema (Detailed Data for AI)
```sql
-- Raw wearable data table
CREATE TABLE wearable_data (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_id VARCHAR(50),
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ,
    heart_rate INTEGER,
    steps INTEGER,
    sleep_minutes INTEGER,
    blood_pressure_systolic INTEGER,
    blood_pressure_diastolic INTEGER,
    data_source VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- AI analysis results
CREATE TABLE wearable_analysis (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_id VARCHAR(50),
    analysis_period_start TIMESTAMPTZ,
    analysis_period_end TIMESTAMPTZ,
    heart_rate_trend VARCHAR(20),
    activity_trend VARCHAR(20),
    sleep_quality_score INTEGER,
    clinical_summary TEXT,
    recommended_actions JSONB,
    alert_level VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Healthie Storage (Clinical Summary)
```graphql
# Single clinical note per analysis period
mutation AddClinicalNote {
  createNote(
    appointmentId: "appt_123"
    content: """
    WEARABLE DATA ANALYSIS (Jan 1-15):
    
    KEY FINDINGS:
    • Heart rate trend: IMPROVED (↓10 bpm average)
    • Activity: MEETING GOALS (8K+ steps daily)  
    • Sleep: NEEDS ATTENTION (5.2hr average)
    
    RECOMMENDATIONS:
    • Schedule sleep study
    • Continue current activity level
    • Discuss sleep hygiene at next visit
    
    ALERT LEVEL: Moderate (sleep concerns)
    """
  )
}
```

## Dynamic Threshold Adaptation

### Personalized Baselines
- **Individual Learning**: AI learns each patient's normal patterns rather than using static population thresholds
- **Context Awareness**: Considers time of day, medication timing, recent appointments
- **Progressive Alerting**: Escalating alerts based on severity and duration of anomalies

### Example Threshold Logic
```python
def calculate_personalized_threshold(patient_id, metric_type):
    historical_data = get_patient_baseline(patient_id, metric_type, days=90)
    
    baseline_avg = historical_data.mean()
    baseline_std = historical_data.std()
    
    thresholds = {
        'normal': (baseline_avg - baseline_std, baseline_avg + baseline_std),
        'concerning': (baseline_avg - 2*baseline_std, baseline_avg + 2*baseline_std),
        'critical': (baseline_avg - 3*baseline_std, baseline_avg + 3*baseline_std)
    }
    
    return thresholds
```
